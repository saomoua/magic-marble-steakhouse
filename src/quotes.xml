        <quote>The steaks were delicious! Perfectly cooked the way I like--medium rare. And the portions were decent size; a great deal for the price. The steakhouse had a variety of alcoholic beverages, and is a perfect spot to hang out with the guys to watch a game.</quote>

        <quote>The steakhouse is a great family dining option. They’re open for brunch on the weekends and have kids-friendly selections. One of my kids has a food allergy, and the allergy indications are very helpful. There’s even an option for me to order online and pick up--dinner has never been so easy.</quote>
